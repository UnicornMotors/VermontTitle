"To use the Vermont title loophole, you need: 
- A bill of sale, which is proof that you purchased the vehicle
- A VIN verification
- A Vermont Registration Tax & Title Application (VD-119)
- A lien release, if applicable
- The NADA value or comparable book value
- Sales tax

The bill of sale can be typed or handwritten, but it must include specific information about the transaction. This includes the make, year, VIN, purchase price, mileage, signature of the seller, and date of sale. If the vehicle is a model year 2012 or newer, you also need an Odometer Disclosure Statement. 

You can download the Vermont VD-119 form, fill it out, and send it with a check for the total amount. You need to calculate 6% of the low NADA value and add it to the $76 registration fee. 

If you're registering a motorcycle, Vermont doesn't title anything under 300cc."
